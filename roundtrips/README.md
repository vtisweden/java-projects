This project is under intensive (further) development; we are currently relying on small example applications for documentation: `se.vti.roundtrips.examples`.

The flexibility of the framework is exemplified by the little `se.vti.roundtrips.simulator.electrified` package, which is sufficent to enable basic fleet electrification analyses.
